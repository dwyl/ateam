## Why

[***Founders & Coders***](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/about/) (**F&C**)
alumni have expressed a ***desire*** to ***continue their learning***
**by freelancing** after the course finishes but *historically* this has been
**problematic as there is no dedicated full time person/people to**:
  + **Finding freelance projects** to be undertaken,
  leading to a lot of *uncertainty for developers and big gaps between projects*
  + **Providing project oversight, removing interruptions/blockers
  and managing the client** (*expectations*), leading to developers having to
  wear too many hats
  ([*Hugh*](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hugh-trueger/1a/696/8a8)
  did this for a while and F&C3 alumni considered
  his position *essential* to the success of their projects)
  + Undertaking ***regular*** **code reviews**, ensuring the project is going in
  the right direction and **vouching for the quality of the code**
  + **Getting the word out about F&C and its offerings**, leading to the
  majority of this weight falling on the shoulders of 1 or 2 people who
  had to try to find 'free' time to do this

Given the lack of resources to bring on such a person or team
(and given no one in the space offered to take this on),
over the summer of 2015 it was **proposed that F&C move to
just help alumni find external employment**.   
This was debated by the employment sub-group and it was decided
that this was also **problematic and not in the best long term
interest of the school** if it could be avoided.

> A ***alternative solution*** is therefore ***required*** to these problems
which will allow **F&C students/alumni** to ***continue learning*** (*by doing*)
after the 16 week course while providing a ***sustainable income***
to fund the mission of **F&C**.


## What?

A proposal for setting up a **commercial organisation**,
run by [@iteles] & [@nelsonic] to provide interesting
and targeted project work (*with oversight and mentorship*) for F&C alumni.
For more, see [responsibilities](#responsibilities).

> The company will be developed **fully open source**
> and ***completely transparent*** creating a ***replicable***
> model for **making free learning sustainable**.

**Stipulations imposed by F&C employment group:**
+ This must be a separate company from Founders & Coders CIC,
so that F&C can focus solely on the ***mission***;
Providing ***great technical learning***, ***free*** and ***open source***.
+ The company will and should sit in on F&C meetings but *not*
have the power to dictate what happens in the school.



# Proposal

## Overview

After the 16 week course, students have a number of options:
+ Start their own project/adventure (*with the support of their peers*)
+ Work on freelance projects of their own accord
+ Work on freelance projects through F&C
+ Find full time employment

**We believe all of these can co-exist.**

This proposes that a ***commercial-focussed organisation*** is formed
- run by [@nelsonic] and [@iteles] in the immediate term -
which will take on these last two, particularly concentrating on
**finding and managing the running of development projects for F&C graduates**.    
*For more on the reasons why this has come about, read the
['Why?' section](#why) above and for more on the
specific responsibilities of the organisation,
read the ['Responsibilities' section](#responsibilities) below.*

> The aim is to create a way to *simultaneously* **make F&C sustainable**
as a project, while still maintaining its *replicability* and providing
alumni with a *continued learning curve* where they ***learn-by-doing***
while doing ***interesting and meaningful work*** after the 16 week course.


## Our Values

![golden-rule-way](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/9929013/f3825e66-5d21-11e5-98eb-0d51b9094368.jpg)

Since we started [**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl),
we've had a
[***clear manifesto***](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md)
that explains ***why*** we do what we do.  
Worth highlighting here are:
+ **Open source.** We want ***every aspect*** of our organisation to be open source,
from the setup and the processes, questions raised and solutions found.
We always [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) 'out in the open'.
We hope this **encourages everyone to contribute, ask and answer questions**.
We're aware this is "***unconventional***", its *deliberate*.

+ ***Full transparency***. Transparent in our thought processes,
in our decisions, in our processes and in everything, right from the [*start*](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here).

+ ***Continuous learning***. ~~good~~ ***great*** ~~developers~~ ***people***
realize that in the pursuit of
[*mastery*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning) (*in any field*)
they can ***never stop learning***.
This isn't *just* about learning code; being *technically competent* is
*essential* but *no longer "enough"*.
It's about going along to client meetings and estimating tasks,
proposing projects and learning all the things you want to learn.
We do it for ourselves and we want to set up an environment that
provides opportunities for everyone to put in the time to do it too.

+ **Keep it simple**. where ever *possible*, ***eliminate complexity***.

+ **Accountability for the work you do**. We're here to *help* people
do their best work for the project **team** they choose to be in.

+ **Treating others the way you would like to be treated**. In *everything* we do, we follow [**The Golden Rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)



Ultimately we value helping everyone we come into contact with
(and complete strangers who find us on the internet) learn and grow.

## Responsibilities

### Freelancing

+ Develop F&C's freelance offering
+ Find and speak to potential clients about projects F&C could work with them on
+ Guide project conversations to ensure realistic scope and expectations
+ Manage client relationships (before, during and between projects)
+ ~~[Scrum mastering](http://scrummethodology.com/the-scrummaster-role/)~~
*Coaching* throughout the project (multiple projects in parallel)
+ Client management throughout the project (multiple projects in parallel)
  + _Note: This does not mean developers will not interact with clients, it means we will intervene to stop constant interruptions_
+ Regular code quality reviews
+ Ensure project lookbacks happen and _lessons are carried through to other projects_ not lost in the ether
+ Ensure shared learning and reuse of code
+ Provide some guidance _during the MVPs_ in the last weeks of the course
  + This helps improve the learning curve, provide some quality assurance, ensures the client relationship is not lost if that team decides to move on from F&C and also helps us get to know students before they start freelancing officially!

### Mentoring

+ Ensure each developer has ***written*** (*personal*) ***goals*** and that they
take steps towards reaching them with every project.
+ Always bring students into client conversations to learn how to
interact with clients, what to expect and how to respond.
+ Aim for people to work on projects that they want to work
on and fit with their personal goals
+ Help direct developers' learning when advice is needed/requested
+ Regular individual catch-ups to *understand* how they feel,
concerns/potential improvements and celebrate achievements.
+ Implement a ***continuous feedback loop***
+ Technical mentorship through code reviews.

**Others:**
+ Maintain F&C's existing and future relationships with employers (those who take on F&C students as permanent employees)
+ Find employment for students who don’t want to be freelancers
+ Develop and run a corporate training offering

**Admin**
  + Financial admin (raising invoices, chasing them, paying devs & contributors, HMRC)
  + Contract admin (between client & company and between company and developers)
  + All project management admin
  + Fielding enquiry emails

## F&C Student journey
  <img width="1579" alt="fac-student-alumni-journey" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/10269399/79c6be2c-6ace-11e5-94f7-3fd5bc894352.png">

## Financials

Calculations based on developers working 80% of the year
(to provide a conservative estimate) suggest that at current
cost levels (£2700 per month rounded up to £3000),
F&C will receive enough income to break even as soon as
there are **7 developers** working on projects.   
*For more on the financials,
read the ['Financials' section](#developers) below.*

<img width="879" alt="fc-breakeven-41-weeks-of-work-a-year" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/10269376/c3e44d0e-6acd-11e5-9613-1c062f0f96ef.png">


### Developers

#### Q: What will people learn?

> Simple answer: *Everything* you need to be a top-rate freelancer or start your own company.

#### Q: What can people expect to get *paid*?

+ All developers will start on **£120** per day
  (equates to £15 an hour for 8 hour days.)
+ Commission for Founders & Coders *does not* come out of developers' day rate
+ Within 4 months, developers will undergo a **peer led** day rate review

+ Commission and structure for bringing in clients and projects will exist and is one of the things that needs to be [researched in the coming month](#next-steps)

#### Developer Income Example

There are [**253**](http://www.work-day.co.uk/workingdays_holidays_2015.htm)
*working days* in a year; everyone should aim to take off
at *least* **25 days holiday**.

That leaves **228** working days.
So the *initial* annual income would be **£27,360**,  
***however*** given the be *peer-led rate reviews* every 4 months
we *expect* rates to be  
*higher* for people who stay for 4, 8 & 12 months.
We *expect* everyone to have *doubled*  
their pay within 12 months - dependent
on projects turnover - so annual income  
*could* be ***above market rates***.

Consider the following scenario:
First let's divide the year into 3 equal parts;
**76 days** *per* "**Tertile**".
Lets assume that a developer's peers deem them
to be ***exceeding expectations*** both in technical ability
and "***delighting the customer***" at each of the first two
peer-feedback sessions.

This will mean:

+ *First 4 months* rate is set at £15/h     --> 76 days x £140/day = £9,120
+ After 4 Months rate increases to £17.50/h --> 76 days x £140/day = £10,640
+ After 8 Months rate increases to £20/h --> 76 days x £160/day = £12,160
+ Total: **£31,920** (*annual*)<sup>1</sup>

We *urge* people ***not*** to focus on the cash amount.
Especially since, if we succeed together
(*in delivering great project results*)
the peer-determined rates could be *considerably* more favorable.

But to give you an idea, [**IBM**'s *Starting Salary* for a graduate is £29,000](https://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/choosing-an-employer/320357-which-graduate-career-offers-the-best-pay)  
and they don't do anything *resembling* the kind of *interesting* & *creative*
*full-service/stack* work we expect to be doing!



### Founders & Coders

+ If people prefer to be placed directly with employers
and this is done through the **comercial organisation**,  
there will be a commission going to F&C -
the amount is to be agreed as part of the [next steps](#next-steps)

For **freelance projects**:

+ F&C will receive 10% of the *charge out rate* (not the developer day rate)
for all alumni working on freelance projects through the new organisation
+ Calculations suggest **F&C will break even as soon as there are just
7 developers working on projects**


## Next steps

*First*, F&C *people* must vote on this proposal.

If it goes ahead, we would need to bring in 1 full time person at market rate for at least 1 month to help with:
+ Research on clients, organisational models and the many open questions that will come up in the coming days/weeks such as 'What is the best CRM system to use or should we build one ourselves?'
+ Creating a solid foundation of processes and tools
+ Code necessary open source tools with us to be used in projects
+ Investigate and confirm/disproove any assumptions made
+ And all the other setup tasks we will encounter!

This will provide a different point of view but crucially also allow
[@iteles] and [@nelsonic] to start speaking to people and find work
that is required in the immediate term.

## FAQs
**Q:** How will the affect F&C's responsibilities

**Q:** What will the interaction be between this organisation and F&C?

**Q:** What if I find a piece of freelance work by myself?
Do I need to bring it to this new company?

**Q:** What about if I find a piece of work and I need a team
of developers from F&C? Do I have to bring it to this new company?

**Q:** What if a client wants me (as an individual) to do a piece of
non-related work for them outside of F&C after I met them through
an F&C freelance project?

### Notes:
<sup>1</sup>We *cannot* guarantee developer income beyond the initial 4 month
term. However provided the person shows proactivity we expect to have
enough work for 10+ people for 12 months.
