## Why
Founders & Coders (F&C) alumni have expressed a **_desire_ to freelance through F&C** after the course finishes but historically this has been **problematic as there is no one dedicated full time to**:
  + **Finding freelance projects** to be undertaken, leading to a lot of uncertainty for developers and big gaps between project
  + **Providing project oversight, removing interruptions/blockers and managing the client**, leading to developers having to wear too many hats (Hugh did this for a while and F&C alumni considered his position essential) 
  + Undertaking regular code reviews, ensuring the project is going in the right direction and **vouching for the quality of the code**

Given the lack of resources to bring on such a person or team (and given no one in the space offered to take this on), over the summer of 2015 it was **proposed that F&C move to just help alumni find external employment**.   
This was debated by the employment sub-group and it was decided that this was also **problematic and not in the best long term interest of the school** if it could be avoided.

>A new solution is therefore required to these problems which would allow F&C to develop its stewardship of students after the 16 week course.
  
  
## What?
A proposal for setting up a new company, run by [@nelsonic] and [@iteles] to provide interesting and targeted freelance work (with oversight and mentorship) for F&C alumni.
For more, see [responsibilities](#responsibilities).

> This company will be developed **fully open source** and completely transparently so as to create a **replicable** model for **making Founders & Coders sustainable**.

**Stipulations imposed by F&C employment group:**
+ This must be a separate company from Founders & Coders CIC, which will now focus solely on the school
+ This company will and should sit in on F&C meetings but _not_ have the power to dictate what happens in the school



# Proposal

## What people value
